# üé¨ Movie App

This repository contains a Movie App developed as a task in **DEPI**.  
The application features two main pages:  

- **Home Page** ‚Äì Displays a list of movies with details.  
- **Watched List Page** ‚Äì Allows users to track movies they‚Äôve watched.  

I focused on implementing **Clean Architecture principles**.  
For state management, I applied different approaches including `setState` for simple scenarios and `Provider` for more complex handling.
